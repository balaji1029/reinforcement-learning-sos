# Reinforcement Learning for SoS

This is my working repo for my learning of Reinforcement Learning. I know, learning how machines learn!!! So cool!!

I started my journey with Sutton and Barto.

I'm done with the theory of 
- Multi-Armed Bandits
- Finite Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)
- Currently going through Dynamic Programming

The problems I've tried are
- Multi-Armed Bandits with various learning techniques
- Jack's Car Rental Problem
- Working on Gambler's Problem

I had to work on Gambler's Problem at the time I was writing this, but yeah! you know what I chose now!!
