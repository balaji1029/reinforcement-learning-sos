% As I embarked on my journey into the realm of machine learning, one area that particularly captured my interest was reinforcement learning (RL). This subset of machine learning stands out because of its unique approach to training algorithms through interaction with an environment. Unlike supervised learning, which relies on a vast dataset of labeled examples, reinforcement learning focuses on learning optimal behaviors through trial and error.

% In reinforcement learning, an agent learns to make decisions by performing actions in a given environment to achieve a specific goal. To draw a simple analogy, consider playing a video game. Here, the agent represents the player, and the environment corresponds to the game world. The player's objective is to make moves that score points or advance levels. Through continuous interaction with the game, the player gradually learns which actions yield the highest scores or successfully complete the levels.

% This learning process is driven by the concept of rewards and punishments. The agent receives feedback from the environment in the form of rewards (positive feedback) or penalties (negative feedback) based on its actions. Over time, the agent aims to maximize its cumulative reward by identifying and executing actions that yield the most favorable outcomes. This method of learning closely mimics the way humans and animals learn from their surroundings, making it a compelling area of study.

% Reinforcement learning has already demonstrated its potential in various domains, from game playing (such as AlphaGo and OpenAI's Dota 2 bot) to robotics, autonomous driving, and even financial trading. Its ability to adapt and improve through interaction makes it a powerful tool for tackling complex decision-making problems.

% As I continue to explore this fascinating field, I am eager to delve deeper into the algorithms and techniques that drive reinforcement learning. Understanding these foundational concepts is the first step towards leveraging RL to develop intelligent systems capable of making informed and autonomous decisions.

This is the report of my project on Reinforcement Learning as a part of Summer of Science 2024 by the Mathematics and Physics (MnP) Club.

This is a branch of Machine Learning along with Supervised and Unsupervised Learning. In Supervised Learning, the model is trained on a labeled dataset, while in Unsupervised Learning, the model just goes through the dataset without any labels.

Reinforcement Learning differs from the both as it learns from the environment by interacting with it. The agent learns to achieve a goal by trying out stuff, getting rewards or punishments, and learning from time to time.

Reinforcement Learning is therefore close to how humans learn from their surroundings. But the way human learns from the environment is too complex and not yet understood completely. But, the RL algorithms are designed to mimic the way humans learn.

This is what made me feel interested in Reinforcement Learning. The work I did in this project is present in the repo \href{https://github.com/balaji1029/reinforcement-learning-sos/} on GitHub. The graphs I plotted, the code I wrote are all present in the repo. The code is written in Python and the libraries used are \texttt{numpy} and \texttt{matplotlib}.
